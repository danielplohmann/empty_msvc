# empty\_msvc
A collection of "empty" MSVC projects (i.e. main() only consists of "return 0"), compiled using various versions and configurations of Visual Studio along their respective PDB files.
Created and maintained by Daniel Plohmann and Daniel Enders.

## What is this good for?

The use case is probably quite special.
For us, this is used as groundtruth in binary code indexing / function similarity context.

## What's the folder structure / naming scheme?

So far, we used

  * MSVC++ 6.0   MSC_VER 1200 (Visual Studio 6.0 Standard)
  * MSVC++ 7.1   MSC_VER == 1310 (Visual Studio .NET 2003 v7.1 Standard)
  * MSVC++ 8.0   MSC_VER == 1400 (Visual Studio 2005 Express)
  * MSVC++ 9.0   MSC_VER == 1500 (Visual Studio 2008 Express)
  * MSVC++ 10.0  MSC_VER == 1600 (Visual Studio 2010 Express)
  * MSVC++ 11.0  MSC_VER == 1700 (Visual Studio 2012 Express)
  * MSVC++ 12.0  MSC_VER == 1800 (Visual Studio 2013 Community)
  * MSVC++ 14.0  MSC_VER == 1900 (Visual Studio 2015 Community)
  * MSVC++ 14.16 MSC_VER == 1916 (Visual Studio 2017 Community v15.9)
  * MSVC++ 14.2  MSC_VER == 1920 (Visual Studio 2019 Community v16.0.2)
  * MSVC++ 14.28 MSC_VER == 1928 (Visual Studio 2019 Community v16.9.2)

and created an empty WIN32 console project both EXE and DLL each and compiled it

  * using Debug and Release mode
  * using the following linking configuration
    * Multi-threaded - /MT (i.e. static linking)
    * Multi-threaded Debug /MTd
    * Multi-threaded DLL - /MD (i.e. linking against the respective MSVCRT)
    * Multi-threaded DLL debug - /MDd
    * Single-threaded - /ML
    * Single-threaded Debug - /MLd
  * for a 32bit and 64bit target where possible

The folder structure we used is:
<visual\_studio\_version>/<build\_version>/<debug|release>/<dll|exe>/<visual\_studio\_version>\_<x86|x64>\_<debug|release>\_<mt|mtd|md|mdd|ml|mld>.<dll|exe|pdb>

## How can I use it?
